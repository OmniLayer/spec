The Vern concept

This concept came about while discussing life with Vern at the beach.  Vern has a depth of understanding of biker communities
that far and away exceeds my limited understanding of them.  He spoke at length about the coming together of different biker 
communities such that they were collaborating in a sort of large-scale biker conference that transcended Harleys or Hondas, 
Nam vets or stuntbikers.  He indicated that there was an increased focus in groups that he was a part of that focused on 
giving back to communities wherever they traveled.  In other words, itinerant groups with different ideas and styles were making 
an attempt to unify to some degree after a fashion with the idea that they would all be making more of an effort to give back more to
communities.  The overall effect of this might be felt differently everywhere and would not be seen everywhere, but as Vern 
described what was being done in more detail, I understood much more of this than I did previously.

I then explained to Vern a bit of what I knew of decentralized cryptocurrencies and what sort of value passed through them,
and how that was given back to the crowd.  I indicated that this might be adapted somehow to let everyone decide how they 
wanted to give and talked about a project that I started -- [http://abis.io](http://abis.io).  Vern said that sounded good,
but he'd make a change, if he could.  He would like to have the option so that there would be a system of finances, such as
financial tokens or some similar system, that would enable local communities (such as cities, or itinerant groups or those in
diaspora, for example, biker communities) to have their own system that would enable them to focus on giving to a few
organizations at a time, since they may be oriented around events or charity causes that their members would focus on.

So out of this conversation has come... The Vern concept.

(keep those ideas coming)
