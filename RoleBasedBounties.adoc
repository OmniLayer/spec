== Role Based Bounties

*Document Version: 0.6*

*Please update the version number whenever you update this document.*

A role based bounty or RBB is the term we use for someone who receives
an ongoing bounty for filling some role for the project.

This is the
http://wiki.mastercoin.org/index.php/Decentralized_Application[DA]
equivalent of an employee in traditional companies.

Right now the Mastercoin Foundation is managing RBBs, but management of
RBBs will move over to the protocol Proof of Stake voting as soon as
that’s implemented.

The reason an RBB exists is to complement the traditional bounty system.
We want to encourage people to work on the project full time, and even
quit their day jobs, and for this they require some stability and
predictability which the one-time bounty system doesn’t really offer.

== How it works right now

* The Foundation decides to allocate a new Role Based Bounty, and they
choose a person to fulfill that role.
* https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AosWigpBxkwZdHhBaUtTZV9MWUpMVWV6U3VJV1RPbmc&usp=sharing#gid=0[The
specific terms are on this Google Spreadsheet]. The current terms are
all identical and include 6000 monthly USD (paid usually in bitcoin),
and some number of Dev MSC depending on the relative amount of MSC
distributed that month. This will change for future hires that come into
the project at a later phase.

The following standard conditions apply to all RBBs:

* In addition to USD or BTC, each RBB also wins a proportional amount of
the Dev MSCs. The amount they receive is proportional to the relative
share of their USD or BTC allocation, out of all the Bounty BTC awarded
that month. Dev MSC is released on a vesting schedule, currently
described here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q6vuIPC7JSCiFKFTsXx24BvGhaXPKpNy2574XeqmAos/edit
(should probably be moved to github)
* The payment schedule is monthly, usually via bitcoins (but we can pay
via other means if needed e.g. wire transfer).
* The position is "`at will`", meaning both the Foundation and the RBB
can terminate the RBB position without any reason.
* We do set a mutual 30 days notice period. Both the Foundation and the
RBB are obligated not to terminate this RBB position without giving a 30
days notice.
* We generally intend to keep RBBs on for a long time, typically a year
or more. However note that just like most jobs, this is not a
contractual obligation given the items above.
* RBBs qualify to receive other outstanding bounties, however the amount
awarded to them via the RBB position in a given month will be deducted
from the total value of other bounties received that month. i.e. if a
core developer contributes above and beyond and wins 10000 USD worth of
bounties in a month, the 6000 USD from their RBB would subtracted from
the award giving them 4000 USD in bounties and 6000 USD for the RBB for
a total of 10000 USD.
* RBBs may manage teams, and the team may qualify for outstanding
bounties. Each team’s budget should be managed independently of the team
lead’s personal funds.

== Signup bonus for C-Level positions

Any C-level hire (e.g. CEO/CTO/CMO) is entitled to a signup bonus. The
purpose of the bonus is to properly reward such key members of the
organization, and make sure they have an extra incentive to promote The
Master Protocol. The bonus works as follows:

. In addition to the Role Based Bounties above, a C-Level position is
entitled to $60,000 ($30,000 worth of BTC and $30,000 worth of MSC).
. These amounts will be vested over a period of 12 months, via a
quarterly vesting / pricing schedule, and a 6 month cliff.
. At the 3 month mark, a. $7,500 will be calculated in BTC and allocated
to the RBB. b. $7,500 will be calculated in MSC and allocated to the
RBB.
. At the 6 month mark, a. $7,500 will be calculated in BTC and allocated
to the RBB. b. $7,500 will be calculated in MSC and allocated to the
RBB. c. All allocated BTC will be paid to RBB.
. At the 9 month mark, a. $7,500 will be calculated in BTC and allocated
to the RBB. b. $7,500 will be calculated in MSC and allocated to the
RBB. c. All allocated BTC will be paid to RBB.
. Finally, at the 12 months mark, a. an additional $15,000 will be
allocated, and the entire bonus MSC pool and BTC pool will be
transferred to the RBB.
. We want to encourage key members of the Foundation to keep these MSC
long term. For this purpose, The Mastercoin Foundation will keep these
bonus MSC, and will send them to the RBB after the sooner of these two
events:
.. A year passes from their signup date, or
.. The RBB quits or is let go. In this case, only the vested portion of
their bonus will be sent, and the rest will be returned to the
Mastercoin Foundation’s budget.

== Converting USD to MSC

For the purpose of this contract, sometime a dollar amount is payable
via MSC (e.g. the Bonus for C-Level positions).

Such calculations are made by using the spot price (best available data)
on the day of allocation (The best price source is used - either a
centralized exchange, the price on a decentralized exchange, or a
combination of these, by our consideration.)

== Hourly Bounties

Some tasks are more suitable to be carried out by hourly "`employees`",
rather than a full fledged Role Based Bounty. We term these Hourly
Bounties. The way it works is:

. We approve a budget for the Hourly Bounty in the usual process (see
the Voting Rules). A standard budget size can be 1,000-2,500 USD, but it
can vary by task.
. We use a standard uniform rate of 40 USD per hour.
. The Hourly Bounty is expected to manage and report his budget and
hours. If the hours run out before the task is completed, or it is an
ongoing task, the Hourly Bounty is expected to ask the Foundation for an
refill of his budget.
. Like other bounties, the Hourly Bounty is entitled to Dev MSC, in
accordance with the

MSC distribution algorithm]

== The Future

Like everything else, we will decentralize any central control to the
RBB protocol. All of the above will be codified in a Proof of Stake
voting system, and it will become part of the official Mastercoin spec.
