This document describes the process of making changes to the Mastercoin
spec. This process is it’s very early stages, and is expected to change
rapidly in the future (e.g. to include
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=309729.0[Voting]). The current
Protocol Owner is J.R Willett.

Right now, there are two possible change mechanisms to the spec
document:

. Developers can fork the repository, work on their own copy, push their
proposed changes, and send a pull request accompanied with a post to
bitcointalk. The Protocol Owner and the community reviews the changes,
and when enough consensus has been generated, The Protocol Owner merges
the changes back to the https://github.com/mastercoin-MSC/spec[parent
repository on mastercoin-MSC].
. Minor and/or non-breaking changes can be made directly on top of the
mastercoin-MSC parent repository, by people who have push right to this
repository. If you want to be included in this group, ask Willett.
. For sake of convenience, people who already have push access to the
parent repository can work on branches instead of forks. This achieves
the same purpose as option 1 above, in a manner that might be more
convenient to some developers.
