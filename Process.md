This document describes the process of making changes to the Mastercoin spec. This process is it's very early stages, and is expected to change rapidly in the future (e.g. to include [Voting](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=309729.0)). The current Protocol Owner is J.R Willett.

Right now, there are two possible change mechanisms to the spec document:

1. Developers can fork the repository, work on their own copy, push their proposed changes, and send a pull request accompanied with a post to bitcointalk. The Protocol Owner and the community reviews the changes, and when enough consensus has been generated, The Protocol Owner merges the changes back to the [parent repository on mastercoin-MSC](https://github.com/mastercoin-MSC/spec).

2. Minor and/or non-breaking changes can be made directly on top of the mastercoin-MSC parent repository, by people who have push right to this repository. If you want to be included in this group, ask Willett.
