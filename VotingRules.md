## One time expenses ##
1. 1 Board member may spend up to $100 without consulting anybody
2. 2 Board members may agree to spend up to $500, as long as there are no objections raised
3. 3 Board members may agree to spend up to $1000, as long as there are no objections raised
4. 4 Board members may agree to spend up to $2000, as long as there are no objections raised

## One time bounties ##
Bounties are treated like expenses, with 1 board member “discount”:

1. 1 board member can put a bounty of up to $500
2. 2 board members can put a bounty of up to $1000, as long as no objections are raised
3. 3 board members can put a bounty of up to $2000, as long as no objections are raised
4. And so forth…

(Note that this is just a copy-paste of the normal Voting Rules tab, with 1 less board member per line).

The Executive Director has the voting power of 2 board members for the purpose of approving one time bounties.

## Hire process for Role Based Bounties ##
1. Any board member can nominate an RBB
2. If 3 other board members support this nomination AND no board member formally objects AND 48 hours from the moment the RBB was nominated, the RBB is hired.
3. If anyone objects OR we fail to reach a total of 4 supporting board members, the discussion continues until the objections are met.

## Monthly Budget ##
At any one time, the monthly expenses that the Foundation is committed to AKA "burn rate" will not go over 75,000 USD (see our [actual burn rate](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtCyUJvk_IyNdGpVcnpBN2tOczFmbVRnck5TWjZuRFE&usp=sharing#gid=8) and [proposed budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtCyUJvk_IyNdGpVcnpBN2tOczFmbVRnck5TWjZuRFE&usp=sharing#gid=3)).

## Discretionary Funds ##
The board may approve a member (such as the Executive Director) to have a larger pool of discretionary funds by unanimous vote

## Objections ##
If an objection is raised, time must be allowed for discussion, and all members must vote if there is still disagreement after discussion. Under no conditions will more than $20k be spent over the objection of any board member.

## Change of these rules and composition of the board ##
A unanimous vote is required to change these rules, or to change the composition of the board

## Documentation of expenses ##
ALL expenditures must be itemized in our public-facing budget spreadsheet (or equivalent)
