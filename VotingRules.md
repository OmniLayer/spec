## One time expenses ##
1. 1 Board member may spend up to $100 without consulting anybody
2. 2 Board members may agree to spend up to $500, as long as there are no objections raised
3. 3 Board members may agree to spend up to $1000, as long as there are no objections raised
4. 4 Board members may agree to spend up to $2000, as long as there are no objections raised
5. 5 Board members may agree to spend up to $5000, as long as there are no objections raised
6. 6 Board members may agree to spend up to $20000, as long as there are no objections raised
7. The board must vote unanimously to spend more than $20000

## Recurring expenses ##
1. If the total sum of the recurrences fits under a specific voting rule for one-time expenses, then this number of board members can approve it. E.g. 3 board members can approve a monthly recurring $150 expense for 6 months.
2. It takes one more board member than usual to approve a recurring monthly expense. E.g. 6 members members can approve a monthly expense of up to $5000 (it takes 5 board members to approve a one time expense of up to $5000).

## Discretionary Funds ##
The board may approve a member (such as the Executive Director) to have a larger pool of discretionary funds by unanimous vote

## Objections ##
If an objection is raised, time must be allowed for discussion, and all members must vote if there is still disagreement after discussion. Under no conditions will more than $20k be spent over the objection of any board member.

## Change of these rules and composition of the board ##
A unanimous vote is required to change these rules, or to change the composition of the board
